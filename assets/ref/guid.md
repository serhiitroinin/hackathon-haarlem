# **AI Training Builder**

Build a system that takes a trainer from a one-sentence idea to a complete, editable PowerPoint deck in Maverx house style — in under 10 minutes.

// BRIEF

## **Maverx Challenge: AI-Powered Training Builder**

### **Your Mission**

Build a system that takes a trainer from a one-sentence idea to a complete, editable PowerPoint deck in Maverx house style — in under 10 minutes. Not a content dump. A structured production assistant that follows a fixed didactic model and keeps the human in control of quality.

(Every Team participating in this Challenge gets 20€ of Openrouter Api Credits, for api key contact the team.)

### **What You Receive**

| Item | What It Is |
| :---- | :---- |
| Style Guide (PDF) | Colors, fonts, logos — the visual rules |
| Master slides (.pptx) | All slide layouts in Maverx house style — use these, don't recreate them |
| Example training (.docx) | A written outline of an existing Maverx training so you understand the structure |

---

### **The Intake**

Your system must ask at least these 5 questions before generating anything:

| \# | Question | Why |
| :---: | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | What is the topic or skill to be trained? | Sets the domain |
| 2 | Who is the target audience? | Sets tone and depth |
| 3 | What is the knowledge level of participants? | Beginner / intermediate / advanced |
| 4 | How long is the training? | Determines module count and slide count |
| 5 | What is the primary learning objective? | Anchors the entire structure |

If input is vague, your system should ask follow-up questions — not guess silently. It should refuse to generate until intake is sufficiently complete.

---

### **The Didactic Model**

Every generated training must follow this structure. No exceptions:

| Block | Purpose |
| :---- | :---- |
| Kick-off | Set learning goals, introduce agenda |
| Theory | Core concepts, explained for the audience |
| Example | Concrete, recognizable illustration of the theory |
| Exercise | Active application — individual, pair, or group work |
| Wrap-up | Key takeaways, link to practice, next steps |

---

### **The Output**

* Format: .pptx — fully editable in Microsoft PowerPoint  
* Layout: Based on the provided Maverx master slides (reference them, don't redraw)  
* Content per slide: Title \+ body text / bullet points — editable text, not screenshots or images  
* Speaker notes per slide, containing all 5 fields: 1\. Aim of the slide 2\. Time indication 3\. Instruction steps 4\. A reflective question for learners 5\. A debrief summary  
* Pre-bite: A short preparation document for participants before the session (article to read, software to install, or reflection question)  
* Post-bite: A follow-up document after the session (reflection questions, assignment, or further reading)

### **Challenge Tiers**

Pick your ambition level. Scope is rewarded only when matched by quality — a polished Tier 1 beats a broken Tier 3\.

#### **Tier 1 — Single Training**

Generate one complete training on a given topic.

Example: \_"Create a 3-hour training on Prompt Engineering for the Marketing team. Participants have no prior AI experience."\_

Required deliverables:

* Intake via targeted questions  
* Generated training structure following the didactic model  
* Full editable .pptx in Maverx house style (\~20 slides) with text, tables, and visuals — not placeholder screenshots  
* Pre-bite and post-bite documents  
* Speaker notes on every slide (all 5 fields)

Bonus:

* In-session exercises: step-by-step exercise description (tool-based) or case handout with model reference sheet (methodology-based)

#### **Tier 2 — Multi-Level Module**

Generate a 3-level learning track: Essentials, Advanced, Expert. Levels must build on each other — Expert assumes knowledge from the lower levels.

Example topics: Power BI, Power Automate, Excel, Claude/AI Literacy

Required deliverables per level:

* Everything from Tier 1  
* Mentimeter recap in sessions 2 and 3 to revisit the previous session

Bonus:

* For tool-based trainings: generate adjustable datasets

Key challenge: Level 2 must presuppose level 1\. Content, exercises, and difficulty must scale logically.

#### **Tier 3 — Certification Track**

Generate a full multi-session certification programme with a coherent narrative thread.

Example: Lean Black Belt — 8 sessions of 2 hours, structured along DMAIC

Required deliverables per session:

* Everything from Tier 1, plus a full case handout (realistic business case \+ model reference \+ space to apply)

Required at track level:

* Logical structure across all sessions (e.g., DMAIC backbone)  
* Consistent fictional case running through the entire track — participants build on their work each session  
* Session overview document showing the red thread, timing, and learning objectives per session  
* Post-bite of session N connects directly to pre-bite of session N+1

Key challenge: Narrative and didactic consistency across 16 hours of training material.

### **What Is Up to You**

We do not judge on:

* Which AI model(s) or APIs you use  
* Whether the interface is a chat, web form, script, or something else  
* How the PowerPoint is generated technically

We judge on results: what comes out the other end.

### **How Your Submission Is Judged**

Your submission is scored out of 100 points across three categories:

| Category | Points | What It Covers |
| :---- | ----: | :---- |
| Challenge-Specific Criteria | 60 | Does it solve the Maverx challenge well? |
| Overall Execution Quality | 30 | How well is it built, documented, and delivered? |
| Innovation Bonus | 10 | Does it bring breakthrough thinking or creative execution? |

#### **Challenge-Specific Criteria (60 points)**

| Criterion | Points | What Matters |
| :---- | ----: | :---- |
| Structural Logic | 21 | Is the didactic arc present? Are exercises matched to theory? Are speaker notes complete? Is timing distributed sensibly? Could a trainer actually teach from this? |
| Output Editability | 18 | Does the .pptx open cleanly in PowerPoint? Is all content editable text/tables? Can titles, bullets, and tables be edited? Does the pipeline handle edge cases? |
| House Style Compliance | 12 | Are Maverx master slides referenced (not recreated)? Are fonts, colors, and logo placement intact? Is layout discipline maintained across all slides? |
| Intake Quality | 9 | Are the 5 required questions asked? Does the system handle vague input with follow-ups? Does it refuse to generate until intake is complete? |

#### **Overall Execution Quality (30 points)**

| Criterion | Points | What Matters |
| :---- | ----: | :---- |
| User Experience | 8 | Is the interface intuitive? Does it handle errors gracefully? Can a first-time user accomplish the core task without reading documentation? |
| Documentation | 6 | Can someone understand what it does, how to use it, and how it works without the team present? Clear README, setup guide, and architecture overview? |
| Polish & Attention to Detail | 5 | Does it feel finished? Visual consistency, edge case handling, no obvious bugs? |
| Setup & Onboarding | 4 | How easy is it to get the system running? Are dependencies clear? Does the first-run experience work? |
| Reproducibility & Code Quality | 4 | Can someone else run it, understand the code, and modify it? |
| Deployment Readiness | 3 | How far is this from production? Could Maverx actually deploy this with minimal additional work? |

#### **Innovation Bonus (10 points)**

* 0–2 pts: Standard hackathon execution; nothing unexpected  
* 3–5 pts: One genuinely fresh idea that adds value  
* 6–8 pts: Multiple creative contributions; you think "that's clever"  
* 9–10 pts: Breakthrough thinking; you think "why hasn't anyone done this before?"

Innovation must add value, not just novelty. A creative idea that ignores the challenge requirements scores low.
